DEAR GRANT

Code overhauled for a lot of things,
so throw existing notions of how
everything works out the window.
Whatever you recognize will probably
be changed soon too.

Be careful of what you touch, please
make note of anything you change.


Todo (that we can remember):
 - Get the mouse stuff working again
(Mouse stuff will use a new method)
 - Replace path AI
 - Sound assets
 - Get all crystal models imported
 into crystal class and ready for
 easy swapping (probably an array of
strings of crystal paths for loading)
 - Get rotation again, will be done
 using pathCreation's update function
 (Note, global and local rotation)
